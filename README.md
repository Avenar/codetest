# codetest

To run this project, first clone the repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have "node" and "npm" installed. Specifically i used Node 16.0.0 for building this.
(If you do not have node/npm installed, please refer to other online guides on how to get it working on your machine)

Open a command prompt, and navigate to the folder you cloned the project to.

Run the following command to get all modules required installed:

npm install

Then afterwards, to start the project up, use:

npm run start

This will boot both the API and the APP concurrently, as well as attempt to open a new browser tab for you, with the project.
If your browser (chrome/firefox/edge) somehow blocks this attempt, instead start the browser of your choice, open a new tab, and navigate to the url:

localhost:3000
